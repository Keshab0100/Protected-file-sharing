I am Keshab Kataruka, I aspire to be a MERN stack developer, I am fluent with HTML, CSS, JS, Node Js and Express Js for web development, for the database I know Mongo Db, SQL, and also recently I have used firebase for authentication and db in a hackathon. I have made quite a few projects using these technologies. I have experience with APIs and have made a few. Currently I am learning React Js to achieve my goal of being a MERN stack developer. I think I am a fit for this role because I have the relevant tech stack and willing to work on real life projects, and solve real world problems, a chance to showcase my skills. I am willing to learn anything new if required, I have confidence that I can implement new things quickly.
